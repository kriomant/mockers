# Mockers

Mocking library for Rust.

Inspired by Google Mock library for C++.

[User Guide]

## Limitations

For now it is not a full-featured mocking library, but just
a prototype to gather feedback. For example, only methods with
four or fewer arguments are supported, non-'static lifetimes are not
supported and so on.

Mocking magic is implemented using compiler plugin on nightly Rust
(it was tested to work with *1.21.0-nightly (aac223f4f 2017-07-30)*)
and code generation on stable Rust. See User Guide for details.

## Usage at a glance

This is a very short introduction to show what is possible and
how it looks. Read [User Guide] for details.

We will use nightly Rust in this example for simplicity.

For multirust, run the following command:
```
$ multirust override nightly
```

Or if you're using rustup:

```
$ rustup override set nightly
```

Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
mockers_macros = "0.9.2"

[dev-dependencies]
mockers = "0.9.2"
```

src/lib.rs:

```rust
#![feature(plugin, custom_derive)]
#![plugin(mockers_macros)]

#[cfg(test)] extern crate mockers;

#[derive(Mock)]
pub trait AirConditioner {
    fn make_hotter(&mut self, by: i16);
    fn make_cooler(&mut self, by: i16);
    fn get_temperature(&self) -> i16;
}

pub fn set_temperature_20(cond: &mut AirConditioner) {
    let t = cond.get_temperature();
    if t < 20 {
        cond.make_hotter(20 + t);
    } else {
        cond.make_cooler(t - 20);
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
  use super::*;
  use mockers::Scenario;

  #[test]
  fn test_set_temperature_20() {
      let scenario = Scenario::new();
      let mut cond = scenario.create_mock_for::<AirConditioner>();

      scenario.expect(cond.get_temperature_call().and_return(16));
      scenario.expect(cond.make_hotter_call(4).and_return(()));

      set_temperature_20(&mut cond);
  }
}
```

Run tests:

```
